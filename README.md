**MAA - Maa Se Dur Maa Ka Khana** is a social-impact driven web application designed to connect individuals living far from home with hygienic, homemade, and affordable meals. It also empowers women‚Äîespecially homemakers, widows, and the differently-abled‚Äîby enabling them to reach a broader customer base through an online tiffin service platform.

## üåü Project Objective

Many people living away from home‚Äîstudents, working professionals, or migrants‚Äîstruggle to find quality homemade meals and often spend a lot on unhealthy restaurant or fast-food options. On the other hand, many women running local tiffin services are unable to expand due to lack of digital exposure.

**Our Solution:**  
MAA bridges this gap by creating a platform where:
- Customers can order hygienic, home-cooked meals.
- Women passionate about cooking can register as chefs and deliver food.
- Users can provide feedback and ratings to ensure service quality.

**Unique Offerings:**
- Homemade food with a personal touch
- Meal categories: Jain, Diet, Non-Veg, Fasting meals, etc.
- Online & COD payment options
- Rating and feedback system for transparency
- Empowering women from rural and urban communities
